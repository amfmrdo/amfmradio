    If you're going to make stickers of your own art, chances are that the manufacturer you are using (if you are) will create the vector outline of your artwork for you to use as the cut line on their machines. But maybe, you aren't using a manufacturer, so you have to create your own cut line. The thing about cut lines, I've learned, is that you can't use raster lines for them, so you can't actually draw your own cut lines in the drawing program itself. If you're unsure of how to create vector lines for your artwork (especially if you don't have Adobe products), look no further... I will teach you a very easy and free method!
    <p></p>
    First of all, take the drawing that you would like to make into a sticker. Make a new layer of that drawing, and color it completely black. Save this file as a .psd file.
    <p></p>
    Next, go to <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea.com</a>, and import your .psd file.
    <p></p>
    Click on your black-colored layer. Now go to Image -> Vectorize Bitmap...
    <p></p>
    You will be greeted with this screen. Just set the color to 2, and the mode to "Photo", and hit "Apply"...
    <p></p>
    And now you've got your very own vector cut line for your drawing. Yippee! You can save this as a .psd file to retain the artwork layer and the vector cut line layer. Note that .psd is a raster file type; but it is able to save vector elements. This file type can be opened in vector programs like Illustrator with no damage to the artwork or vectorized cut line.
    <p></p>
    A small tip; if you are dealing with images with lots of colors and are unable to make a single-colored layer beforehand, and you would like to get some vector outlines/cut lines for it, I found that setting the number to as low as possible (2-5 is a great range) and setting the mode to "Photo" does the trick.
    <p></p>
    I hope this is helpful!
