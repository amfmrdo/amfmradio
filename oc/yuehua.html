        Everyone's favorite friendly neighborhood jiāngshī is here! Yuèhuā is a waitress in her family's well known restaurant. Many find her charming due to her looks and eccentric personality, but she's oblivious to how people perceive her and frequently misses social cues.
        <p></p>
        She has known <a href="jiayi.html">Jiāyī</a> and <a href="jiafeng.html">Jiāfēng</a> since middle school. She considers Jiāyī to be the person she is closest too, hanging out with her all the time, yet is painfully unaware of Jiāyī's romantic interest in her. She doesn't understand half the things that Jiafeng is up to and even sometimes gets caught up in their antics, but still considers them a "nice person".
        <p></p>
        In her free time, she likes to craft little paper stars and fill up jars of them to give to the people she likes. She has the ability to eat strange things without getting sick so if you hang out with her enough you'll get to see her eating a live insect.
