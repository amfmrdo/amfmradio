        Kina has a nasty personality. There’s no “hidden sweet side” to her at all. She’s loud, selfish, unempathetic, and has very little patience for others. Her parents sent her to college in hopes that she learns to get her life together, but she dropped out because she hates listening to them and wants to do things and live life her own way; that is, making questionable choices and doing things she isn't supposed to do all the time.
        <p></p>
        She half-freeloads off her only friend <a href="joshua2.html">Joshua</a>. She spends all her time arguing with strangers on the internet and watching tv shows.
        <p></p>
        Online, she’s fairly popular as a breakcore artist. She thinks this is the same as being a famous celebrity and has a superiority complex because of it. Joshua actually helps her with composing music too; but she takes the credit all for herself. Joshua doesn’t care and lets her.
