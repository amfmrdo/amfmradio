        Jiāyī is very matter-of-fact and straight-to-the-point. Some mistaking her bluntness as rudeness. It doesn't help that she's extremely shy; and all of these traits combine to make it hard for her to not be awkward.
        <p></p>
        She's <a href="jiafeng.html">Jiāfēng's</a> sister and <a href="yuehua.html">Yuèhuā's</a> friend since middle school. She initially found Yuèhuā to be weird and tiring to talk to because of how much Yuèhuā underestimates her social battery, but she's thankful for it now because she finds it extremely easy to approach and talk to her. So much that Jiāyī has developed a crush on her...
        <p></p>
        She and Jiafeng have a stereotypical sibling bond. They often bicker and roll their eyes at each other. Jiāyī isn't a fan of the antics that Jiafeng pulls, especially when they affect her.
        <p></p>
        She wears those big spiked collars because she thinks Chun-Li from Street Fighter looks cool and wants to be like her.
