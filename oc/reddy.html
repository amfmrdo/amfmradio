        Reddy was raised in a small village of grandmas and grandpas on a tiny military-occupied island state named Wogaph. Growing up, he didn’t go to school but instead spent his days with older folks and foreign fishermen who sought economic opportunity in Wogaph's coasts. He naturally grew up to be a fisherman and a polyglot because of it.
        <p></p>
        He travels to various easian/seasian countries as a part of his job and became used to living nomadically. He catches mostly crab and fish. Sometimes, he cooks and eats his own catches. He's actually quite good at cooking after having to take care of a bunch of old people in his youth. He has a few loose screws and comes across as offputting a lot of the time, especially since he wears his heart on his sleeve. He acts kind of effeminate sometimes.
        <p></p>
        He has a not-very-subtle crush on <a href="tacha.html">Tacha</a>.
