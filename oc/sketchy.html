        Sketchy grew up on a small far-off planet named Vraslun and lived peacefully with his family until his planet was invaded and plundered for resources by Demise Corp's militant branch. Sketchy managed to narrowly escape via an escape pod, but not before witnessing the destruction of his home planet and the death of everyone he has ever known. The escape pod was programmed to return to where it was built; so Sketchy found himself winding up as a refugee on Eris.
        <p></p>
        After learning that she is now stranded on the very same planet her invaders came from, Sketchy was fueled by resent and a need for revenge. Through her.. 'morbid creativity'.. she succesfully created and hosts a popular gameshow that runs on TV. Its premise? Contestants are forced to unwillingly participate in literal games of life and death! The more violence, the merrier! Is this legal? No one knows, but since she regularly threatens power over Demise Corp, they let her keep it running.
        <p></p>
        Sketchy makes it outwardly known how much she hates <a href="enua.html">Enua</a> and her goals and calls her unpleasant things on live TV.
