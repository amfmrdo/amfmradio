        No one really knows what Gintaro's deal is or what he does. He's <a href="jiayi.html">Jiāyī's</a> and <a href="jiafeng.html">Jiāfēng's</a> adoptive father and raised them both when they were "abandoned in cardboard boxes all alone in the side of the rainy road", according to himself. Not even his kids really know what he does.
        <p></p>
        He's lazy, and likes to sleep on the couch all day. He's so lazy that he refuses to talk, and when he does he does so in a very informal manner. When he's away, he can be away for days at a time.
        <p></p>
        There's a famous legend in the town that a long, long time ago, an evil dragon named Orochi had awoken from hundreds of years of slumber and was set to spread doom to the world, but a heroic cockatrice battled and defeated him. Gintaro claims that he's never heard of this story in his life. When you tell him you've told him this story before, he'll just say that his memory doesn't function as well as it used to.
