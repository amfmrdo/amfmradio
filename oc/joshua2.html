        Joshua is softspoken and generally nice, but introverted, shy and keeps to herself. She’s only “friends” with <a href="kinashyero2.html">Kina</a> because Kina disrespects her boundaries, and she's too powerless and tired to stop her a lot of the time.
        <p></p>
        Has a fascination with computers, consoles and electronics since she was a kid. While she's studying in college she fixes people's electronics as a part time-job as she knows her way around how things work. Her other part-time job is being forcefully made to help Kina compose bad breakcore music; Joshua records the sounds and noises made by the broken electronics she's fixing and later gives the recorded sound files to Kina for her to use in her music.
        <p></p>
        Secretly, she likes doing arts and crafts projects and she enjoys sewing, doodling, and making things she's too shy to share with anyone.
