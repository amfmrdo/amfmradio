        Weslie's whole life seems to revolve around her wanting and doing the most absurd things. This means that if's a regular tuesday afternoon and she decides she wants to be a contestant in a monster truck fighting contest without her having any driving knowledge or connections at all, she'll find a way to do it. Somehow. It's scary. She's like a cartoon character. If you tell Weslie that she isn't supposed to be doing something, she'll tell you 'not to worry because she has a permit', and then proceed to hand you a written piece of paper stating "I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT."
        <p></p>
        She's a little much to deal with, but if you're good friends with her she has a lot of love, support and weird jokes to give. She'll even think about sharing with you her snacks.
        <p></p>
        She's in a band with her friends called My Fault Universe. She hopes one day she can be a famous musician.
