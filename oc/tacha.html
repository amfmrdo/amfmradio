        Tacha was raised in a strict family as the eldest daughter which explains why she is the way she is. She's a high-functioning alcoholic who comes off as cold and direct to everyone and has trouble being vulnerable. Freakishly good at masking and hiding her emotions which explains her lack of friends. Has a very logical way of thinking. It can be hard to reach her and understand her as she tends to keep people at arm’s length.
        <p></p>
        She's competent at a lot of things as a result of her needing independence very fast. She would be a dependable person if she wasn't so intimidating and impatient. She almost always wears a poker face and few things make her smile.
        <p></p>
        Because she tends to isolate herself from people, she hated <a href="reddy.html">Reddy</a> at first because of his constant curiousity of her, but very slowly got used to his presence. Sometimes she even replies and reacts to the things he says and does!
