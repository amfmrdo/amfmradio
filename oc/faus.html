        After being created as God's first soldier, Faus was sent down to a post-apocalyptic Earth to kill all the few remaining survivors for God to finally be able to reshape the planet in his ideal vision; only to find out that Faus unexpectedly retains the compassion and empathy that humankind once had. Now, Faus defends the last of Earth's inhabitants - and himself - against God and his subsequent soldiers.
        <p></p>
        He wields two revolvers crafted in his image and two daggers given to him as a gift by the inhabitants he protects.
        <p></p>
        Being God's first attempt at creating a soldier, Faus has various deformities. One of them includes the mutant mouth he has that prevents him from speaking. He communicates via body language and hand signs. He also seems particularly more fragile compared to others of the same species and solely relies on his speed and dexterity rather than his strength.
