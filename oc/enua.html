        A sly and cunning alien, Enua is one of the top dogs illegally overseeing and manipulating the operations of Demise Corp; a mega corporation that owns and operates a mass number of companies, media outlets and programs all around the solar system.
        <p></p>
        The corporation's existence has been a cause for many hardships for Enua growing up. As a child she lost her whole family to a disease outbreak caused by its biochemical experiments in which treatment was too costly for any of them to afford. She barely managed to scrap by, and later on found a niche in doing sex work. It worked out so well that she quickly became one of the richest and most well-known aliens on Eris, and she now uses her wealth and reputation to take control of Demise Corp and rule the solar system.
        <p></p>
        Enua constantly tries to sabotage <a href="sketchy.html">Sketchy's</a> operations because she's aware of the threat they bring to her plans.
