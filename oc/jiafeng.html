        Jiāfēng jokes that being part angel is what makes people worship them, because somehow they have managed to amass hundreds of thousands of followers online. They specialize in shooting videos of a variety of topics; mostly anything in trend.
        <p></p>
        They have a sarcastic personality and always wants to be up in people's businesseses. They know when they're purposely being irritating and it's not uncommon for them to overstep people's boundaries. This annoys their sister <a href="jiayi.html">Jiāyī</a> greatly, and she's often embarassed to be related to them. <a href="yuehua.html">Yuèhuā</a> on the other hand doesn't see anything wrong with it and finds them to be very fun.
        <p></p>
        They have a secret weakness: They get mad when others acknowledge that they are part pigeon and hates being called one, saying that "pigeons are more boring than angels".
